1.0.0 - 2021-08-31
------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Aligned to orjson’s flags and features of SIMD. Didn’t include the
  stable compilation part as seems unnecessary.

Misc
~~~~

- Fixed pyproject.toml to work with newest maturin version.

0.3.6 - 2021-08-24
------------------

Misc

~~~~

~~~~~

- Fixed ``ormsgpack.pyi`` support of str as input for ``unpackb``.

Misc
~~~~

- Fixed Windows CI/CD.

0.3.3 - 2021-07-23

Misc
~~~~

- Refactored adding objects to the module, creating a ``__all__`` object
  similar to the way PyO3 creates. This solves an issue with upgrading
  to new maturin version.
- Changed < Py3.7 implementation to use automatic range inclusion.
- Added test to validate correct Python method flags are used on
  declare.
- Changed to use PyO3 configurations instead of our own.
  (:pr:`25` by :user:`pejter`)

0.3.2 - 2021-07-13
------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Fix memory leak serializing ``datetime.datetime`` with ``tzinfo``.
  (Copied from orjson)

Changed
~~~~~~~

- Update dependencies, PyO3 -> 0.14.1.

Misc
~~~~

- Setup dependabot.

0.3.1 - 2021-06-25
------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

- ``packb`` of maps and sequences is now almost 2x faster as it
  leverages known size. (:pr:`18` by :user:`ijl`)

Misc
~~~~

- Added ``scripts/bench_target.py`` and ``scripts/profile.sh`` for
  easily benchmarking and profiling. Works only on Linux.
  (:pr:`17` by :user:`ijl`)

0.3.0 - 2021-06-13
------------------

Added
~~~~~

- ``unpackb`` now accepts keyword argument ``option`` with argument
  ``OPT_NON_STR_KEYS``. This option will let ormsgpack unpack
  dictionaries with non-str keys. Be aware that this option is
  considered unsafe and disabled by default in msgpack due to
  possibility of HashDoS.
- ``packb`` now is able to pack dictionaries with tuples as keys.
  ``unpackb`` is able to unpack such dictionaries. Both requires
  ``OPT_NON_STR_KEYS``.

Misc
~~~~

- Grouped benchmarks in a pattern that should make more sense.
- Added pydantic docs to ``README.md``
- Added graphs and benchmark results.

0.2.1 - 2021-06-12
------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

- Depth limit is now enforced for ``ormsgpack.unpackb`` - function
  should be safe for use now.

Removed
~~~~~~~

- Removed ``OPT_SERIALIZE_UUID`` from ormsgpack.pyi as it doesn’t exist.

Misc
~~~~

- Added ``scripts/test.sh`` for running tests.
- Added benchmarks, modified scripts to match new layout.

0.2.0 - 2021-06-10
------------------

Added
~~~~~

- Add support for serializing pydantic’s ``BaseModel`` instances using
  ``ormsgpack.OPT_SERIALIZE_PYDANTIC``.

Fixed
~~~~~

- ``ormsgpack.packb`` with ``option`` argument as
  ``ormsgpack.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS`` serializes bytes key into tuple of
  integers instead of using bin type. This also resulted in asymmetrical
  packb/unpackb.

Misc
~~~~

- Added ``--no-index`` to ``pip install ormsgpack`` to avoid installing
  from PyPI on CI.

0.1.0 - 2021-06-09
------------------

First version, changed orjson to ormsgpack.
